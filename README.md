# Codsoft

Codsoft is a collection of Python projects that explore different applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The repository demonstrates practical implementations of technologies like face detection, chatbot interaction, and game development.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. **ChatBot.py**
   A chatbot built using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The bot can understand and respond to user inputs, offering an interactive conversational experience. This project utilizes libraries like `nltk` and `tensorflow` to train and deploy the bot for real-time conversations.

### 2. **FaceDetectionRecognition.py**
   This project employs machine learning techniques for face detection and recognition. It uses OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades to identify and recognize faces in real-time through a webcam. This implementation is commonly used for applications like security systems and personal identification.

### 3. **TicTacToe.py**
   A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project demonstrates the creation of a text-based game in Python, which allows users to play against each other. The AI opponent is powered by a basic algorithm that enables it to make moves automatically based on available spaces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `opencv-python`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `nltk`, etc.
